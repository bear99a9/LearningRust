##Stack Vs Heap

Stack is small memory. 

So data to be big for the stack to hold the heap will take it. 

Data on the stack is easier to find than on the heap. 

You use pointers to get it from the Heap.

##Data Types

Scalar => Numbers, characters and Booleans
Rust uses a 4 Byte size allowing for unicode-32 table or 4294967296 total chars

Compound => Arrays, Tuples

Strings
